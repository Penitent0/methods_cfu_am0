# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

**It still feels strange that there are built in methods that only work on certain data types and they are not all formatted correctly. For example, I had to use the Math.sqrt method for one of my solutions and the formatting was odd.**

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

**I feel fairly comfortable writing simple methods on my own if I understand what problem I am begin given to solve.**

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

**At what level to experienced programmers know or memorize all of the available methods? How will I know if there is a built in Ruby method for a particular problem or when I will need to try to create my own?**
